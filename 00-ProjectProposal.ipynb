    "Competitive online video games such as Valorant, a team-based first-person-shooter, provide a natural setting to study how reward and failure influence persistence. Wins and losses are not merely outcomes of play; they engage reinforcement learning mechanisms supported by dopaminergic reward signaling. A common misconception of dopamine is that dopamine neurons always activate upon receiving positive rewards. However, research in Reward Prediction Error (RPE) shows that dopamine neurons don't just respond to any reward: they respond only to rewards that differ from their prediction.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Take food, for example: you realize the dining hall just added your favourite food to the menu, so you ecstatically purchase it. Perhaps the next day, you'll get it again. But if you continue to buy it every single day, for 3 meals a day, for an entire month—you'll probably be sick of it, despite it having been your favourite food. The same applies in games—if you only ever win, at some point you'll get sick of it and quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "RPE suggests that unexpected outcomes can shape motivation and prolong engagement, but that still requires the right amount of variability in reinforcement schedules. Just as winning too much can dull your gameplay experience, losing too much could deter you from wanting to experience more. Most players believe that competitive MMR (Matchmaking Rating) systems aim for players to have roughly a 50% win/loss ratio, as \"it means it's where you should be,\" (in terms of rank and skill) but some have also noted that it also creates negative feelings caused by being \"hardstuck,\" <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). a phenomenon where players reach a bottleneck in terms of win/loss ratio, resulting in stagnant rankings that can contribute to feelings of demotivation. Hence, there is reason to suspect that MMR systems are not so transparently \"50/50.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior works show that there is a temporal attractiveness in uncertainty and resolution—uncertainty is worth it because resolution awaits<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Our desire to move from a state of \"unknown\" to \"knowing\" is in itself valuable, regardless of whether the outcome is positive or negative. This added value of uncertainty is coined \"resolution utility,\" (Ruan et al., 2018, Shen et al., 2019) <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and is crucial to why player's don't \"quit halfway.\" The result of this research not only provides reasons for why continuous gameplay occurs, it also helps validate that a player's decision to stop playing is determined by what happens after resolution, rather than issues arising during gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We specifically chose competitive Valorant because the added layer of social rewards in tandem with wins/losses will provide a stronger reinforcement effect. Competitive Valorant segregates players by skill, resulting in increasing game difficulty as the player improves, thereby ensuring that reward outcomes continue to be variable in nature<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The rank labels displayed on player accounts introduce social status and evaluation, which can increase motivation to continue playing and make the decision to stop a more consequential choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize that ending a gaming session may come from a variety of reasons: fatigue, obligations (e.g., work or school), social factors, technical interruptions, and more. However, this project focuses on whether match outcome patterns have a statistically meaningful relationship with variation in play duration, which, if found, would indicate cause beyond these background factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project asks whether win–loss patterns correlate with continuous play duration in competitive Valorant. If such relationship is found, we then ask whether we are able to predict \n",

    "We believe that there is a strong relationship between win/loss outcomes and continuous play duration in competitive Valorant. We predict that players will tend to play longer after losses or alternating win–loss streaks compared to consistent winning outcomes, reflecting loss aversion and variable reinforcement effects. Because ranked games involve both dopaminergic reward feedback and social motivation through visible rank, we expect these outcome patterns to increase player persistence within a session. \n",

In an ideal dataset, we would also have various control variables including player rank (to control for skill variation), game mode (ranked vs. casual), match duration (to account for fatigue and time constraints), and party information (playing with friends vs. alone). These factors may influence both outcome and persistence, so controlling them would increase the validity of our analysis.\n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although we are not directly collecting data from human subjects through surveys or experiments, we are collecting publicly available player statistics through official APIs provided by the game developers. Players did not explicitly provide consent to our specific project, so we will treat the data as potentially sensitive and avoid using it in ways that could harm individuals, such as targeting or profiling specific players.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Data obtained from official game APIs may not represent all players equally. Some players may have private profiles, may not appear due to API limitations, or may be more likely to play ranked/competitive modes. This introduces selection bias and may overrepresent certain types of players, meaning our results may not generalize to the entire player population.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Player usernames, IDs, and account identifiers may count as personal identifiers because they can be linked back to individuals. We will avoid collecting unnecessary identifiers, and we will not publish raw usernames or IDs in our final report. If we need examples, we will anonymize them and focus on aggregated statistics rather than individual-level data\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Official game APIs generally do not provide demographic information such as race, gender, or age. Because of this, we cannot evaluate fairness across protected demographic groups. We will avoid making social conclusions beyond the scope of game performance data and will clearly communicate these limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will store API-collected data locally or in a private repo environment only accessible to the project team. Since the dataset may contain player identifiers, we will avoid sharing raw scraped data publicly and instead publish cleaned/aggregated versions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We currently do not have an automated system for deletion requests. However, since this is a class project and the dataset is small, if a user requests removal, we can manually delete their records from our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This dataset is only being collected for the duration of the course project. After the project is complete, we will delete the raw dataset containing player identifiers and retain only aggregated results or summary statistics if needed for documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> This project uses publicly available game performance data through official APIs. We are not directly engaging with players or stakeholders, so we may miss context such as differences in playstyle, region/platform differences, or reasons why players choose to be tracked. We will avoid making claims about “player skill” beyond what the statistics directly support.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge potential biases such as overrepresentation of ranked players, region/platform differences, and selection bias due to tracker.gg coverage. We will report these biases explicitly and avoid generalizing results to all players.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We will avoid misleading charts and will clearly label sample sizes and filtering conditions. We will also include uncertainty or distribution information rather than relying only on averages.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> We will avoid exposing player usernames or unique identifiers in plots/tables. Analysis will focus on aggregated statistics (rank distributions, win rates, etc.) rather than profiling individual players.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will document the scraping pipeline, preprocessing steps, and filtering decisions in our notebook/code. This ensures the analysis can be reproduced and checked for errors or bias later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We are not building a model intended for decision-making about people, but we will still avoid interpreting correlations (ex: region/platform) in ways that imply unfair conclusions.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We do not have protected group attributes, so fairness testing is not feasible.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We will consider that performance metrics like K/D ratio or win rate do not fully represent skill. We will compare multiple metrics and avoid ranking players using one metric alone.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed\n",
    "> Since we plan to use linear regression, our model is interpretable and explainable. Each feature has a coefficient that describes how changes in that feature are associated with changes in the predicted outcome (holding other variables constant). We will report coefficients and avoid using overly complex black-box models.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will include a limitations section explaining tracker.gg coverage issues, scraping constraints, and reasons why conclusions may not generalize to all players.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> This is not a deployed system; it is a one-time analysis project.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> We are not deploying a public-facing tool, but we will avoid publishing identifiable data that could harm individuals.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable since this is not a production system.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> Scraped player data could potentially be used for harassment or targeted profiling. To reduce this risk, we will not publish raw scraped datasets with usernames/IDs and will focus only on aggregate-level results in our public report.\n"
