    "Competitive online video games such as Valorant, a team-based first-person-shooter, provide a natural setting to study how reward and failure influence persistence. Wins and losses are not merely outcomes of play; they engage reinforcement learning mechanisms supported by dopaminergic reward signaling. A common misconception of dopamine is that dopamine neurons always activate upon receiving positive rewards. However, research in Reward Prediction Error (RPE) shows that dopamine neurons don't just respond to any reward: they respond only to rewards that differ from their prediction.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Take food, for example: you realize the dining hall just added your favourite food to the menu, so you ecstatically purchase it. Perhaps the next day, you'll get it again. But if you continue to buy it every single day, for 3 meals a day, for an entire month—you'll probably be sick of it, despite it having been your favourite food. The same applies in games—if you only ever win, at some point you'll get sick of it and quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "RPE suggests that unexpected outcomes can shape motivation and prolong engagement, but that still requires the right amount of variability in reinforcement schedules. Just as winning too much can dull your gameplay experience, losing too much could deter you from wanting to experience more. Most players believe that competitive MMR (Matchmaking Rating) systems aim for players to have roughly a 50% win/loss ratio, as \"it means it's where you should be,\" (in terms of rank and skill) but some have also noted that it also creates negative feelings caused by being \"hardstuck,\" <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). a phenomenon where players reach a bottleneck in terms of win/loss ratio, resulting in stagnant rankings that can contribute to feelings of demotivation. Hence, there is reason to suspect that MMR systems are not so transparently \"50/50.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior works show that there is a temporal attractiveness in uncertainty and resolution—uncertainty is worth it because resolution awaits<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Our desire to move from a state of \"unknown\" to \"knowing\" is in itself valuable, regardless of whether the outcome is positive or negative. This added value of uncertainty is coined \"resolution utility,\" (Ruan et al., 2018, Shen et al., 2019) <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and is crucial to why player's don't \"quit halfway.\" The result of this research not only provides reasons for why continuous gameplay occurs, it also helps validate that a player's decision to stop playing is determined by what happens after resolution, rather than issues arising during gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We specifically chose competitive Valorant because the added layer of social rewards in tandem with wins/losses will provide a stronger reinforcement effect. Competitive Valorant segregates players by skill, resulting in increasing game difficulty as the player improves, thereby ensuring that reward outcomes continue to be variable in nature<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The rank labels displayed on player accounts introduce social status and evaluation, which can increase motivation to continue playing and make the decision to stop a more consequential choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize that ending a gaming session may come from a variety of reasons: fatigue, obligations (e.g., work or school), social factors, technical interruptions, and more. However, this project focuses on whether match outcome patterns have a statistically meaningful relationship with variation in play duration, which, if found, would indicate cause beyond these background factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project asks whether win–loss patterns correlate with continuous play duration in competitive Valorant. If such relationship is found, we then ask whether we are able to predict \n",

    "We believe that there is a strong relationship between win/loss outcomes and continuous play duration in competitive Valorant. We predict that players will tend to play longer after losses or alternating win–loss streaks compared to consistent winning outcomes, reflecting loss aversion and variable reinforcement effects. Because ranked games involve both dopaminergic reward feedback and social motivation through visible rank, we expect these outcome patterns to increase player persistence within a session. \n",

    "Our dataset would require match timestamps to determine consecutive gameplay (which would act as out independent variable), and match outcomes to evaluate win/loss streak effects (our dependent variable). In an ideal dataset, we would also have various control variables including player rank (to control for skill variation), game mode (ranked vs. casual), match duration (to account for fatigue and time constraints), and party information (playing with friends vs. alone). These factors may influence both outcome and persistence, so controlling them would increase the validity of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because win/loss patterns occur over repeated matches, in the most ideal situation, we would collect thousands of matches across many players. For example, a dataset of ~50–100 players with several hundred matches each (10,000+ total matches) would provide enough statistical power to examine session-level relationships and variability across individuals. \n",

Match history is only accessible by direct-search, meaning we would need consent from individual players to access their data. \n",

A shared problem across all of these APIs is they they provide individual player information searched by an input player ID, therefore we will use an algorithm to randomly generate player IDs, check if those IDs are valid, then request the API for that player's data, ideally making a randomly selected dataset. \nSome potential APIs we could use are:\n",

It requires having an account to use it, and a dynamic rate limit, which might make data collection harder, but other than that it's completely free use and follows the same data usage policy as Marvel Rivals itself so all player data on it is by default public and ethical to use. This API returns match history with full breakdowns of each game (the only relevant data from this is win or loss) organized by season and gamemode with timestamps which makes it fit all of our requirements, but it requires searching by player ID so we will have to do the random selection described before.\n",
